This is my first vim script and there are plenty of bugs.  If you can help out, please do.

This script is a plugin to be used with the winmanager plugin (see vimscript #95).  The script searches all your buffers for TODO, FIXME, NOTE, BUG, XXX comments found in your code and presents them in a list.  You can sort the list by type, file, line number, date, or by the text of the todo.  You can also customize the columns in the todo list.

Commands:
=========

<cr> : open todo under cursor
p : [p]review todo under cursor
C-w z : close preview window
x : zoom todo list window
s : cycle [s]ort field
c : toggle preview on [C]ursorHold
y : toggle s[y]ntax
r : [r]everse sort
? : toggle help
